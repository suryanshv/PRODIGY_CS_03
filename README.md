Password Complexity Checker 
Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria  such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and  special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

This tool is used to check password complexity to make it difficult for hackers to guess the password of your ID. It checks various criteria to determine whether a password is weak, moderate, strong, very strong. 

Password Criteria
Length - Length of password should be minimum 8 characters long
Uppercase - Atleast one Uppercase characher (A-Z)
Lowercase - Atleast one lowercase characher (a-z)
Numbers - Atleast one numberical characher (0-9)
Special character - Atleast one special characher (!@#$%^&*/*-+(){}[];:'",<.>/?`~)

Working - User enters a password, this tool will check all the criteria mentioned above to calculate the strength of password and give the result whether the password is 
Weak means it is missing 4 criteria out of 5
Moderate means it is missing 2 criteria out of 5
Strong means it is missing 1 criteria out of 5
Very Strong means it isn't missing any criteria out of 5

Use longer passwords for more security and more stronger password and don't use common words like hello@123, admin123, and dont use details you have entered in your email address like name, birthdate and year etc
